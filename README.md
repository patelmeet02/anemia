# Anemic Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) based system for the **detection of anemia**, a global health issue characterized by low hemoglobin levels. The system leverages clinical medical parameters and other medical data to accurately predict the presence of anemia in patients, providing a non-invasive, efficient diagnostic alternative to traditional blood tests.

## Features
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees for classification.
- Provides automated prediction with high accuracy, helping in early diagnosis.
- Non-invasive and cost-effective, suitable for use in remote or resource-limited settings.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation phases.

## Usage
- Prepare your dataset of medical parameters.
- Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare data.
- Train the ML model using:


- The system outputs predicted anemia status and associated metrics like accuracy and ROC curves.

## Methodology
- Data collected from clinical intraoral reports.
- Features extracted from medical reports.
- Multiple ML algorithms are compared for best performance.
- Cross-validation and metrics evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC) ensure robust model quality.

## Results
- Models such as Gradient Boosting Classifier have achieved accuracy exceeding 85%, with potential improvements using larger and diverse datasets.
- The ML models can support healthcare professionals in diagnosing anemia rapidly and reliably.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome to enhance the dataset, improve models, or extend functionality.
