# üöÄ Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Anemic Disease Detection System to various hosting platforms.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ A GitHub account
- ‚úÖ Your project pushed to a GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- ‚úÖ Production-ready Flask app (already configured)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Version Compatibility

**Important**: Some deployment platforms use Python 3.12 by default, which has compatibility issues with certain packages. We've included:
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.7 for better compatibility
- `requirements-deploy.txt` - Alternative requirements with version ranges for more flexible deployment

## üåê Deployment Options

### Option 5: Vercel (Alternative)

Vercel can host Flask apps with some configuration.

#### Steps:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Create `vercel.json`**
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "Flask/app.py",
         "use": "@vercel/python"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "Flask/app.py"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

## üîß Environment Variables

Some platforms may require environment variables. Common ones include:

```bash
# For production
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False

# For database (if you add one later)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# For security
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### Heroku
```bash
# View logs
heroku logs --tail

# Check app status
heroku ps
```

### Railway
- Logs are available in the Railway dashboard
- Real-time monitoring included

### Render
- Logs available in the Render dashboard
- Automatic health checks

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Python 3.12 compatibility errors (distutils module not found)**
   - **Solution**: Use `requirements-deploy.txt` instead of `requirements.txt`
   - **Alternative**: Ensure your platform uses Python 3.11 (check `runtime.txt`)
   - **Command**: `pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt`

2. **App crashes on startup**
   - Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
   - Verify the `Procfile` is correct
   - Check logs for specific error messages

3. **Static files not loading**
   - Ensure static files are in the correct directory
   - Check Flask static file configuration

4. **Model file not found**
   - Verify `model.pkl` is in the Flask directory
   - Check file permissions

5. **Port binding issues**
   - Ensure your app uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`
   - Don't hardcode port numbers

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Test locally with production settings
export PORT=5000
python Flask/app.py

# Check if all dependencies are installed
pip check

# Test the app
curl http://localhost:5000
```

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Most platforms support automatic deployment when you push to GitHub:

1. **Enable auto-deploy** in your platform's settings
2. **Push changes** to your main branch
3. **Platform automatically rebuilds** and deploys

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

| Platform | Free Tier | Paid Plans |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Heroku | 550-1000 dyno hours/month | $7/month+ |
| Railway | $5 credit/month | $5/month+ |
| Render | 750 hours/month | $7/month+ |
| PythonAnywhere | 1 web app, 3 months | $5/month+ |
| Vercel | 100GB bandwidth | $20/month+ |

## üéØ Recommended Deployment Strategy

1. **Start with Heroku** for simplicity
2. **Use Railway** for better performance
3. **Consider Render** for cost-effectiveness
4. **Upgrade to paid plans** as your app grows

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the platform's documentation
2. Look at the deployment logs
3. Test your app locally first
4. Create an issue in this repository
